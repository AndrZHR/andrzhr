| **I know what is important to do to secure my node and server, I respect the rules of privacy, decentralization (I rent servers in the most unusual places, of course focusing on quality as well) and stability. For the last point I always keep a free server, to which I can always quickly and accurately move the node and continue to work on the network.** |
| **I am a system administrator by education, I am well versed and knowledgeable in Ubuntu and similar systems. I solve any error as quickly as possible without any consequences for the nodes installed on the server.** |
| **Below I present you screenshots and links to projects in which I participated or participate in now, have a nice view** |
